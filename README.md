hey! this is a website recreated from @benjitaylor. I liked it so I recreated using:
 - NextJS 13
 - TailwindCSS

first, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

now, run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. :)
